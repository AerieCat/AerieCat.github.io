    hkmori is the artist that got me into breakcore. i forgot how exactly i was first introduced, but i fell in love with the genre soon after. also, a fellow capital letter hater :3

    one of their songs: anyone can find love (except you) has found a place in meme culture as it is a pretty raw example of simple breakcore. Unfortunately the newfound fame has been more negitive for the artist than possitive and they have not taken well to it.

    <h3>anyone can find love (except you)</h3>

    This song is the classic, the most steriotypical depressing breakcore song there is, and it is so good. This song is overstimulation given sound. It is and will always be, a classic breakcore song.

    <h3>What even is b@#$%core?</h3>

    This song is a follow up to the classic anyone can find love (except you). Once it started getting some popularity, drama was stirred up since it was one of their first works and isn't as polished as some of the newer ones are. hkmori remixxed it into this wonder of a song that feels like a panic attack over the first song, probably exactly what they were going for.

    <h3>tearsoaked pillows</h3>

    I like this track mostly because i remember listening to Monster by Meg and Dia as a kid so this song is nastolgic to me, but it is made better with the insane breaks paired with it.
