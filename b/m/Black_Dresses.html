        I've been obsessed with this band for the past week, listening to the albums over and over. They are a trans group who make very relatable songs about transgender issues and mental illness.

        This is a song about transphobia and mainstream conservative Christian transphobia specifically. I believe all trans people in the United States at least have been affected by this rhetoric. People thinking they know best for us without actually asking us or trying to find out more about our problems and struggles. Unfortunately, a lot of this rhetoric tends to get <a href="https://translegislation.com/">passed into law</a>.

        This verse really hits home with what the song wants you to take away from the relationship between transphobic people and tran people:<br><i class="indented-lyrics">
            Everything is movement, everything is hypochondriac<br>
            And pieced together from the fragments of losing<br>
            Sight of what I thought you wanted me to be<br>
            Though I've tried and it almost killed me<br>
            You cannot know this. You cannot pretend to be close with me<br>
            Psychosis batters at your worldview and gnosis<br>
            Whoa, it's only been a minute and a moment<br>
            And you're already done<br>
        </i>
        Everything is movement refers to the fact that laws and the availability of healthcare for some is wavering and at the whims of others. hypochondriasis, meaning an obsession with the health of one's self is compared to the obsession trans people have to healthcare as it can be taken away from a multitude of people (as it was for anyone under the age of 18 in many states around March of 2023). The next part refers to the way many trans people forget their former self, often through repression. When forced to be who we aren't, many trans people become depressed, detached, or suicidal, as stated in the next line. Non trans people cannot really feel what it's like to be trans, and thus can't really relate to the experiences, even and especially if they claim to speak for us as many people do when they decide things for us. The worldview of transphobes is often hypocritical and based on unjust hierarchies and religious scripts as denoted by the term "gnosis" meaning divine knowledge essential to [christian] salvation.

        My relationship with religion has been a rocky one, although i had left the church before i started transitioning, a lot of the rhetoric i had absorbed from church stuck with me for a long time afterward and effects me even now. Religious communities, even if they don't explicitly condone transgender identities or homosexuality, they make the topic taboo and leave people with these identities to wonder if they will have support if they come out. This question was  devastating to me because the consequences for getting it wrong were devastating. If you think you may have community, but you don't, you lose everything, especially for a young person still reliant on that community for support while if you think you won't and you do, you'll feel awful for the time you've wasted overthinking it while you could have started your transition early.

        My advice to religious folk or all folk who are allies is to make it obvious.
