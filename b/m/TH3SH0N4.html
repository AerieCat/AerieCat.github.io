        To my knowledge, this artist is only on youtube, as of March 1st, they have 265 Subscribers and put a lot of effort into their songs. They've come out with 
        music videos for a few of their songs even though they average less than 1k views each. 
        <br>
        The sound itself is very chaotic. bringing back old memories of cyriak videos. also some of the art goes hard.

    One of the things i like about this artist is the way they use notes that aren't usually played together to create a sense of unease, they also use a lot of samples from animes, im sure if i watched more anime i'd get the impact
