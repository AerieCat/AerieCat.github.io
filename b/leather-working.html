    <h1>Leather working blog</h1>
    <p>
        I started a new hobby lately, Leather working. It was pretty cheap to get into, only costing about $50 for all the tools and materials to let me make some cool and simple things.

            <p>The first thing i made when learning the craft was a notebook cover. It is a simple leather cover made with a peice of black leather and a few more to make a pencil strap. It also has an elastic to keep it together. I tried my best to clone the <a href="https://shop.travelerscompanyusa.com/pages/travelers-notebook">travelor's notebook passport size</a> but to size it to fit <a href="https://www.moleskine.com/en-us/shop/notebooks/journals/cahier-journals/?prefn1=size&prefv1=Pocket%203.5x5.5%20in">moleskin cashier journals</a> because i can get those in person and have a strong hatred of online shopping. I'll write more about my journalling in a later blog.</p>

            <p>A friend asked me to make them a collar, so i oblige as it seemed like a good started project. fast forward to the end and i had so many bells and whistles im sure they had no idea how much effort i was putting into it. I started with an autocad drawing of what i wanted it to look like. double checked with my friend, and a week later it was completed. I had to buy some buckles online because they apparently don't carry very many sizes in store. the actual thing has like 10 hours put into it.</p>

                I have large feet, and i mean like, hard to find anything in my size large. One day my aunt gave me some yellow wedge shoes and i was ecstatic because i finally had some in my size. Unfortunately, they were yellow and i have a long standing vendetta against the color yellow. Not wanting to give up hope, i decided to remake them with black leather. Half my wardrobe being black, i knew i'd at least be able to match them with something. I took apart the shoe and used the fabric it was made of as a pattern for the new shoe. both shoes have the same pattern, but look slightly different because i learned different techniques throughout the building of the shoes. From far away you can't tell though. I added a lace up back and ankle tie.

                I made a corset for my renfair costume. I boned it with <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Commercial-Electric-11-in-Stainless-Steel-Cable-Tie-10-Pack-MLG-300ST-10/203531940">steel zipties</a> from the hardware store and learned not to overthink a project. I used a free pattern i modified for myself, attached below. I used hook and eye fasteners to close it in the front, sewing them directly into the leather, and used a leather lace to lace it up in the back.

            The 4 panel pattern is printable on A4 paper. The handbook has handy things like what pieces to print and how many.

                Tools you'll need to get started
            </h3></summary>
            <li><b>cutting knife</b> i used a small kitchen knife as my leather cutting knife, make sure it us sharp, a scalpel or exact-o knife might work better</li>
            <li><b>cutting board</b> i used a wooden cutting board i had in the kitchen</li>
            <li><b>awl</b> i bought this for like $3. it's just like a little ice pick for marking things. you use this to make little marks in the leather before you punch a hole or cut</li>
            <li><b>mallet</b> i got this fro like $4 from walmart, just a rubber mallet, used to hammer things into the leather like grommets</li>
            <li><b>hole punch</b> i got a cheap one for $8 and it works fine, rotary hole punch with 6 different sizes. used for making holes</li>
            <li><b>leather sewing needles</b> you can get a pack for a dollar, these needles are thicker than normal needles because the thread is larger</li>
            <li><b>leather glue</b> glues things together, pretty permanent, fabric glue works too, just see if it lists leather on the tube</li>
            <li><b>clips</b> i <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3383066">3d printed</a> mine </li>
            <li><b>rivet/grommet setter and anvil</b> you need a special tool to set the grommets and rivets honestly i use pliers to set grommets and my rivet setter came with my first box of rivets</li>
            <li><b>leather slicker</b> another tool for edges, my edges look pretty terrible atm</li>
            <li><b>bee's wax</b> is the stuff you put on the edges to make them look better (you use the slicker to set it in)</li>

            <li><b>waxed cord</b> this is what i use with the sewing needles to sew the project together. I like the look of the big cord on my projects, makes it look really rigid (and it is very hard to break)</li>
            <li><b>rivets</b> easy to use, looks really cool, good ascetic</li>
            <li><b>grommet</b> when you want a hole, use a grommet. used them to put holes in a shoe so i can lace them up</li>
            <li><b>D ring</b> metal ring shaped like a D</li>
            <li><b>O ring</b> metal ring shaped like a O</li>
            <li><b>Buckle</b> buckles look cool and used to combine 2 straps with variable length</li>
            <li><b>Leather Lace</b> i like to use leather lace anywhere where someone will have to interact with strings, like for lacing up a shoe. it looks nice</li>

                How to get cheap leather to practice on
            </h3></summary>
        <p>
            <a href="https://www.hobbylobby.com/Crafts-Hobbies/Leather-Craft-Supplies-Tools/Leather-Pieces/Assorted-Leather-Remnants---3-Pound/p/42214">Hobby Lobby</a> has some scraps of leather they sell for really cheap. They sell by the pound in small bags. I like to get the 3lb bags for $5.99, the pieces are very small, the largest i've gotten is about a foot long and 6 inches in width, but they are good for small beginner's projects. They don't tell you the weight or anything about it, however, but since i'm just learning the basics, it's fine. Some bags are better than others so when you're getting them, try to look for some good pieces.

            If you have any other ways please <a href="../#home/contact">reach out</a>, I'm still learning, we don't seem to have any other stores that sell leather supplies besides hobby lobby and i hate online shopping.

                Tips and tricks
            </h3></summary>
            <li>soak the leather in water for a few minutes then you can form it to whatever shape you need. It will mess with it's texture a bit though.</li>
            <li>use the awl to poke holes in the shape of the pattern then use a knife to connect the dots. (it's my current cutting method)</li>
            <li>use a peice of 1/4 inch graph paper as a guide to use the awl to set your points before you punch them</li>
            <li>punch holes before you try to sew 2 peices of leather together with the waxed cord</li>
