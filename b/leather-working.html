    <h1>Leather working blog</h1>
    <p>
        I started a new hobby lately, Leather working. It was pretty cheap to get into, only costing about $50 for all the tools and materials to let me make some cool and simple things.
    </p>

    <h2> the tutorial section</h2>
    <div class="scrollable-segment">
        <h2>
            Tools you'll need to get started
        </h2>
        <li><b>cutting knife</b> i used a small kitchen knife as my leather cutting knife, make sure it us sharp, a scalpel or exact-o knife might work better</li>
        <li><b>cutting board</b> i used a wooden cutting board i had in the kitchen</li>
        <li><b>awl</b> i bought this for like $3. it's just like a little ice pick for marking things. you use this to make little marks in the leather before you punch a hole or cut</li>
        <li><b>mallet</b> i got this fro like $4 from walmart, just a rubber mallet, used to hammer things into the leather like grommets</li>
        <li><b>hole punch</b> i got a cheap one for $8 and it works fine, rotary hole punch with 6 different sizes. used for making holes</li>
        <li><b>leather sewing needles</b> you can get a pack for a dollar, these needles are thicker than normal needles because the thread is larger</li>
        <li><b>leather glue</b> glues things together, pretty permanent, fabric glue works too, just see if it lists leather on the tube</li>
        <li><b>clips</b> i <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3383066">3d printed</a> mine </li>
        <li><b>rivet/grommet setter and anvil</b> you need a special tool to set the grommets and rivets honestly i use pliers to set grommets and my rivet setter came with my first box of rivets</li>
        <h2>
            tools i don't have that i should probably get
        </h2>
        <li><b>beveler</b> this tool makes sharp edges less sharp by beveling them</li>
        <li><b>leather slicker</b> another tool for edges, my edges look pretty terrible atm</li>
        <h2>
            things you can use in the projects that look cool
        </h2>
        <li><b>waxed cord</b> this is what i use with the sewing needles to sew the project together. I like the look of the big cord on my projects, makes it look really rigid (and it is very hard to break)</li>
        <li><b>rivets</b> easy to use, looks really cool, good ascetic</li>
        <li><b>grommet</b> when you want a hole, use a grommet. used them to put holes in a shoe so i can lace them up</li>
        <li><b>D ring</b> metal ring shapped like a D</li>
        <li><b>O ring</b> metal ring shapped like a O</li>
        <li><b>Buckle</b> buckles look cool and used to combine 2 straps with variable length</li>

        <h2>How to get cheap leather to practice on</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="https://www.hobbylobby.com/Crafts-Hobbies/Leather-Craft-Supplies-Tools/Leather-Pieces/Assorted-Leather-Remnants---3-Pound/p/42214">Hobby Lobby</a> has some scraps of leather they sell for really cheap. They sell by the pound in small bags. I like to get the 3lb bags for $5.99, the pieces are very small, the largest i've gotten is about a foot long and 6 inches in width, but they are good for small beginner's projects. They don't tell you the weight or anything about it, however, but since i'm just learning the basics, it's fine. Some bags are better than others so when you're getting them, try to look for some good pieces.

            If you have any other ways please <a href="../#home/contact">reach out</a>, I'm still learning, we don't seem to have any other stores that sell leather supplies besides hobby lobby and i hate online shopping.
