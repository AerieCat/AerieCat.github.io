    <h1>Aerie's mental health Journey</h1>
    This is the "time line" of my mental health journey. Over the past year (2023) 
    i have gone from knowing nothing about myself or my psychology to having half a dozen 'problems' on my doctor's page. 
    The Journey began in may 2023 and before January 2023 i had had no prior mental health counseling.
    There seems to be a disconnect between the part of my life and mind that goes by [Deadname] and the part that goes by Aerie that i identify with. Not sure if 
    it's a true disconnect or a made up one.
    I put a lot of self blame on [Deadname] as the one who stole my childhood and fucked up my brain to begin with. in the early days of the battle (April through 
    August?) i found myself using i for myself and I for [Deadname]. This has continued until today even though i feel i have killed him. (This does not apply to 
    the capital letter at the beginning of sentences.)
    <h2>structure of timeline</h2>
    This timeline is a bit spuratic, im talking most of it from the books i keep with me that i write notes in. sometimes im a diligent note takers and sometimes 
    theres weeks i don't write anything. the dates in the months are not "things happened on this date", they are from timestamps i wrote in the book. since i 
    always go left to write if i timestamp something for the 5th, i know everything after it was after the fifth.

    <h2>childhood realizations:</h2>
    <li>I felt like i couldn't be open about my feelings too anyone. This left me with 2 decades of repressed feelings</li>
    <li>I was bullied verbally throughout school but didn't realize it was bullying unti



    <h2>2023</h2>
    <h3>January</h3>
    In january I began the process of trying to start transitioning. I was still going by [Deadname] at that time. My mom began to be worried about me and said i 
    could only transition 
    if i started seeing a counselor so I met a counselor through my school who was also trans and he helped me cope with the changes that would happen when i choose 
    to start.
    <h4>20</h4>
    this is the day i contacted a doctor's office about starting my journey, i was booked for the 24th to come in for an initial appointment,
    <h4>24</h4>
    i went to and was given the informed concent paperwork. i signed it and they took my blood and urine tests.

    <h3>February</h3>
    I was super excited to start hormones, the longest 2 weeks ever
    <h4>6</h4>
    This is the day that lives in my head as my new birthday, the day i finally started to take my HRT. Not only that but i also rejected my old identity on this 
    day and took the name Aerie on a whim as it was a nickname a friend gave me. (I chose the spelling)
    I started dressing femininely the next day, starting with just a feminine top on masculine pants. 
    <br>
    by the end of the month i had started socially transitioning to the closest of friends.
    <br>by the end of February i was wearing entirely feminine tops with masculine pants and was still using the pockets of those pants
    
    <h3>March</h3>
    i don't remember much about March at this time. I remember some of the earlier signs of transition. Erectile dysfunction, skin smoothening, etc. and was much 
    happier and more confident. I finished socially transitioning to people i interacted with daily (outside of the classroom) around this time.
    <h4>11</h4>
    I had gone to New York on a trip with my mom. I presented femininely the entire time wearing a women's coat and scarf for most of the trip, this is the first 
    time i was in a society that was more excepting and i was gendered correctly half the time. later my mom asked if she could post the pictures with me dressed 
    femininely and i accepted. At this point i was out to most of my family and people i knew.
    by the end of April i was wearing fully feminine outfits to the point of carrying a purse, i was passing half the time. I was out to everyone i knew and had left 
    my old identity behind. I was now fully Aerie in 1 month
    
    <h3>April</h3>
    April is the month i started keeping notes, not very well and many aren't about the self. <br>
    At this time i was struggling with my sexuality, I considered myself asexual at this point and was struggling with the romantic aspect of love. I felt aromantic 
    as i had believed i had never felt romantic attraction toward anyone before and that left me sort of broken, helpless feeling that one thing that seemed to bring 
    so many others joy i was simply incapable of.
    <br>I was also hurting because of misgenders, I started writing down any time it happened and assigned myself a lot of self blame for not being "feminine enough"
    <br>at this point i started trying to separate myself from [Deadname]. I don't remember the context but an exurb i wrote down was 
    <div class="quote-box">
        <p class="quote-text">
            I am a whole other person from  they are dead and i killed them. none of their baggage effects me.<br>
            We are separate beings with separate interests and needs, we want different things and we are only related through continuity.
            <br><b>late April 2023</b>
        </p>
    </div>
    At the end of April i was wearing makeup daily and had a style down. At this point my style was labeled "grandmacore" by my peers, a label i would play into 
    
    <h3>May</h3>
    In may i had finals, it went smoothly and I got a job at Target in Midtown Atlanta in fulfillment, this gave me a lot of time alone with just me and my thoughts. 
    This turned out to be really bad for me later on.
    <br>After the semester ended my name change form went through and i got my first ID with my name on it.
    <br>
    At this point i was still really beat up about being unlovable, it seemed pointless to me now, how would i find someone when i was at school when school was out. 
    my hatred of computers took me off of dating apps but i started to have some slight suicidal (2) nights because of this. 
    I wrote in my notebook reasons i felt that i didn't have a partner as <i>"Asexual, Sad a lot, Not fun to do things with, No dating experience, Unrelatable"</i> I 
    also wasn't really trying at the time, but i was under the assumption it wasn't worth it because i was unworthy of love.
    <br>
    <br>It was toward the end of this month that a friend of mine noticed i had dissociated at one point and told me to get it checked out my a mental health 
    professional
    <br>At the end of this month i felt i was passing 70/30, id pass too 70% of strangers i talked too. 
    <h4>27</h4>
    I went to Momocon with a friend, this was the first time i wore a skirt in public and i wore cat ears, a tail and collar, at this point i had almost given up on 
    societal expectations of masculine clothing.
    
    <h3>June</h3>
    <h4>3</h4>
    I attended Athens pride with some friends from back in my childhood town. we had a great time and i presented extremely femineinely, it was my first time going 
    to a pride event since i started transitioning.
    i decided to go with the label "recipromantic" after believing i had feelings only for people that also had feelings for me (1 example i could think of at the 
    time)
    <h4>12</h4>
    Started a new notebook.
    <br>I started to theorize about my dissociative situation. I wrote in my notes on the subject on the 12th:
    <div class="quote-box">
        <li>I feel like a different person than who i was before</li>
        <li>the body belonged to him and i took it over</li>
        <li>I had a girl in my head when i was little</li>
        <ul><li>This is a reference to when i was little and i believed myself to have 2 voices in my head, a male and a female. I don't remember much about it 
            anymore</li></ul>
        <li>I refer to my past self with he/him pronouns while using she/her for myself</li>
        <li>I need reminders that this is the "real world"</li>
    </div>
    At this point i had started visualizing this past self with the face of my past self, specifically me from 2020<br> 
    I wrote another day that i believed myself to have become the person i wished i could have dated. this is a reference to my measure of self worth from my 
    "femboy days" being how likely i would be to date myself<br>
    I began to see a gap between my consciousness and the world. a floating sensation where i would perceive my self as floating a few feet off the ground. I also 
    investigated my memory issue and believed it to be from not being completely conscious of the world around me or whatever it is im trying to store memories of. 
    I can't store good memories of my physical surroundings without being completely conscious of them and i can't be completely conscious of them with background 
    derealism.
    <br>I related my findings to my childhood when people would say i was "in my own world" in a derogatory manner when i wasn't paying attention. although that 
    could have been a manner of things.
    <br>I found that one of the exchange students my family hosted that i was close too was now presenting as nonbinary
    <br>I wrote about my hatred of being called smart as i felt it was an aspect of [Deadname] and as a result i tend to hide my intellect.
    <br>I picked up Shibari as a hobby as i felt like having a hobby that wasn't digital
    <br>I went to my practitioner and requested a therapist and got one through my doctor's office.
    <h4>therapy sessions start</h4>
    I learned some grounding techniques to use at work as i was often dissociating then.
    I was also told to create a crisis plan incase it gets bad, mine included a call to my mom and deep breaths.
    I tried grounding techniques including music, chew toys, and blankets. 
   
    <h3>July</h3>
    <h4>1</h4>
    I convinced myself that Aerie was the true self and that it was probably societal pressures that created [Deadname]. 
    <br>I started to tell people about my dissociations. My mom said that she thought i just lost my common sense sometimes. This is probably a reference to the 
    autopilot my body seems to function on when i leave it. My Aunt said I would seem distracted. 
    <br>I had dinner with a friend when i remember afterward that i dissociated halfway through a conversation. I forgot why.
    <br> My therapist tries to find reasons for these dissociations. We come up with trans-microagressions triggering regressions led to them. I was also told to as 
    my friend about what i was like when dissociating so we can figure out if someone else was fronting or if i just left. She told me i had just left and it seemed 
    like i was just tired specifically: i was unchanged and didn't respond to some of her comments. 
    <br>I came up with another theory (this happens a few times): My mind couldn't cope with being male so it came up with a way to escape when confronted with the 
    idea.
    <h4>8</h4>I got spooked by my own reflection when i moved too fast and it moved with me. 
    <h4>9</h4>
    <p></p>I wrote a small description of what i was seeing when i was really derealized at work one day "my peripheral vision if fuzzy and you con't focus on 
    anything"</p>
    <h4>10</h4>
    <p>I started crying when told i deserved food. </p>
    <h4>12</h4>
    <p>I recorded my fist instance of warped time. I was at work and the entire day went by in what felt like 2 hours. it was a 6 hour shift.</p>
    <h4>14</h4>
    <p>I started to use pet regression as a coping mechanism more than i should, starts the oversleeping</p>
    <h4>17</h4>
    <p>I dissociated during the entire bagging process of an order, i had to redo it afterward as many things were in the wrong bags. </p>
    <h4>19</h4>
    <p>I was told by my therapist i may have ADHD</p>
    <h4>23</h4>
    <p>I feel like a burden to my friends and family, still feeling like too much of a burden for a partner</p>
    <h4>27</h4>
    <p>I had a dizzy spell, it lasted over na hour, i was well hydrated and had never had this happen before, i was eating dinner and could not get the 
    spoon to my mouth. I ran into a wall and stubbed my toe. </p>
    <h4>29</h4>
    <p>I used the dissociation to get through work. I went into it on purpose and seemed to "time travel" to the end of my shift in 30 minute increments. </p>
    
    <h3>August</h3>
    <h4>1</h4>
    <p>was referred to a psychiatric nurse by my current therapist and went to the appointment where i noticed i have a <b>vastly reduced fear of danger and death. and a very low sense of accomplishment or pride</b>. 
    i was told my dissociations was a defense mechanism and in February i took my walls down, this would explain why they have been much worse since then. 
    i was given <b>mirtazapine</b> to help with depression since at the time we believed our dissociations to be caused by depression. I was told to study 
    psychology and dissociative disorders. I was told i have Dissociative Amnesia and DPDR.
    <h4>2</h4>
    <p>
    4:30: I cried in my car for 30 minutes before work about the overwhelming weight of these new mental revelations, showing up late. I went nonverbal for 
    the first long period of time this day, it lasted 4 hours. I could give short answers to questions (1-5 words) by 8:30. was missgendered at 8:42 and 
    dissociated for a long while. 
    </p>
    <h4>3</h4>
    Dissociated harder than i ever had, started at 12:30, drove to work on autopilot. time traveled through work. noticed what was happening at 3:15 and 
    was back to normal at 5:00. 
    <h4>6</h4>
    first day since the psychiatric appointment that i felt normal
    <h4>9</h4>
    Stood on a ladder at work and looked down and the ground looked fake. 
    Realized the vast majority of dissociative episodes happened at work when im not interacting with people. when i was doing cashier work, i was fine. 
    Spending ours all day with nothing to do except think is bad for my mental health. remembered the quote "people who think too much have nothing to 
    think about but thoughts"
    <h4>12</h4> Started school/quit job and the dissociations got much better.
    The mirtazapine made me extremely tired and hard to get out of bed, didn't do much for the first 2 weeks, fell behind in school. Started a support group for LGBT 
    people through the school. 
    Spent a week sewing a cat bed from scratch to lay on. i get better sleep now. 
    <h4>25</h4>
    tried to make ramen for dinner but saw one of my roommates had eaten all my ramen, this left me really distraut and i cried for a lot of the night. 
    This somehow unlocked suppressed memories of being groomed online at the age of 15. 
    
    <h3>September</h3>
    Theorized that my asexuality or failure to look for a relationship may be a result of my trauma from grooming.
    It was suggested by a friend that i may have CPTSD. 
    cuddled someone for the first time it was platonic but it was nice to have intimacy. Ended up having 2 people to cuddle this month.
    I have a "cat mode" that comes out from time to time when you scratch behind my ear. this led to the making of <a href="http://petregress.com">petregress.com</a>
    <h4>2</h4>
    This was the first time i remember the derealization wearing off by itself. I was walking around on a nature trail. I noticed how my hand looked and also failed 
    the pronoun test. <br>
    I was very depressed this month although i didn't know it at the time so i didn't write much down
    
    <h3>October</h3>
    took up the philosophy of presenting how i wanted to be perceived, "My body is a canvas and i am the artist"
    <h4>14</h4>
    went to atlanta pride with my friends. had a lot of fun. 
    developed a very strong friendship where i feel i can be more vulnerable with this person. They remind me i have friends, and that i am loved. this makes me cry to 
    them. the first time i've cried to someone over something positive in my recollection. A very positive experience.
    <h4>20</h4>
    Had a horrible suicidal experience (4) after being left on read by 2 people on the same day. I was paralyzed with fear of myself. I knew if i got out of bed i 
    would probably end up attempting. The next day i removed all knives from my room. This happened again a week later. It was compounded by the stress of school and not 
    doing any of my assignments weighing on my.

    <h3>November</h3>
    <h4>6</h4>Went to a psychiatric appointment, told them about my suicidal experience and was prescribed Buspirone. 
    I had a bad dizzy spell/vertigo, first time it has happened. It lasted until i went to sleep. I couldn't stand up. 
    I went to the beach with my family in the Bahamas. I wore a swimsuit for the first time in public as well as wearing very feminine dresses very often on the trip. 
    It really boosted my confidence. After this trip i had almost no gender based social anxiety. 
    On the week after i finally contacted my professors about not doing any homework the entire semester. I had only gone to a few of the classes for exams only. I 
    talked to my professors and cried infront of 2 of them. I was given extensions on alot of the homework, but was still doomed in a couple classes.

    <h3>December</h3>
    I worked really hard on my schooling then had a few days off before i went back home. I went back on the 16th and cam back to school on the 20th before heading 
    back home on the 23rd. We went to Paris for New Years on the 26th til January 2nd. 
    
    <h2>2024</h2>
    <h3>January</h3>
    In the begining of the month i felt very refreshed and excited.  Iwas going to make sure this semester was better. 2 weeks in it faded into my old ways with the 
    second week of the semester leaving me mildly depressed (1). 
    <h4>20</h4>
    I had really bad vertigo at noon, almost hard to walk. it lasted a few hours until i decided to try to ground myself for about 15 minutes. it finally went away 
    after 3 hours.

    <h3>the pronoun check:</h3>
    I would ask myself "If someone saw me right now, they would say '___'" and wait for my brain to fill in a pronoun. my brain would be more likely to 
    fill in a 'he' when dissociating. This also correlates with mood
