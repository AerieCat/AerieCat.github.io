    <h2>Aerie's mental health Journey</h2>
    This is the "time line" of my mental health journey. Over the past year (2023) 
    i have gone from knowing nothingabout myself or my psycology to having half a dozen 'problems' on my doctor's page. 
    The Journey began in may 2023 and before January 2023 i had had no prior mental health conceling.
    There seems to be a disconnect between the part of my life and mind that goes by [Deadname] and the part that goes by Aerie that i identify with. Not sure if it's a true disconnect or a made up one.
    I put alot of self blame on [Deadname] as the one who stole my childhood and fucked up my brain to begin with. in the early days of the battle (April through August?) i found myself using i for myself and I for D̸̲̩̗̮͉͗̐̀̇̃̐͌̀̏ë̶̢͙̲͊̌̕ͅã̵̛̼͇̮̤̥̣̯̳̭̠̬͕̟͓̣̍̀̉̽̚̕d̷̯͆́̃̓͒̉̓̑́̆̀̈͠n̶̛͍̞̜̠̤͓̆̽̀͌̋̆͗̃͋̋̔͆̋̚͜a̶͇̯̲͍̼̜̳̻̠̤̘̥̲͓̋̀͊̈m̷͈̰͖͂͛̓̋͒̋̄̽̏͠͠ė̸̡̨̝͈͕̭̝̃̀̑. This has continued until today even though i feel i have killed him. (This does not apply to the capital letter at the begining of sentences.)
    <h2>2022</h2>
    <h3>April</h3>
    I found out that of of my close childhood friends was trans
    <h3>September</h3>
    I came out to my parents after thanksgiving,, they seemed concerned at the time. 
    <h2>2023</h2>
    <h3>January</h3>
    In january I began the process of trying to start transitioning. I was still going by [Deadname] at that time. My mom begane to be worried about me and said i could only transition 
    if i started seeing a councelor so I met a councelor through my school who was also trans and he helped me cope with the changes that would happen when i choose to start.
    <h4>20</h4>
    this is the day i contacted a doctor's office about starting my journey, i was booked for the 24th to come in for an initial appointment,
    <h4>24</h4>
    i went to and was given the informed concent paperwork. i signed it and they took my blood and urine tests.
    <h3>Febuary</h3>
    I was super excited to start hormones, the longest 2 weeks ever
    <h4>6</h4>
    This is the day that lives in my head as my new birthday, the day i finally started to take my HRT. Not only that but i also rejected my old identity on this day and took the name Aerie on a whim as it was a nickname a friend gave me. (I chose the spelling)
    I started dressing femininely the next day, starting with just a feminine top on masculine pants. 
    <br>
    by the end of the month i had started socially transitioning to the closest of friends.
    <br>by the end of Febuary i was wearing entirely feminine tops with masculine pants and was still using the pockets of those pants
    <h3>March</h3>
    i don't remember much about March at this time. I remember some of the earlier signs of transition. Erectile dysfunction, skin smoothening, etc. and was much happier and more confident. I finished socially transitioning to people i interacted with daily (outside of the classroom) around this time.
    <h4>11</h4>
    I had gone to New York on a trip with my mom. I presented femininely the entire time wearing a women's coat and scarf for most of the trip, this is the first time i was in a society that was more excepting and i was gendered correctly half the time. later my mom asked if she could post the pictures with me dressed feminely and i accepted. At this point i was out to most of my family and people i knew.
    by the end of April i was wearing fully feminine outfits to the point of carrying a purse, i was passing half the time. I was out to everyone i knew and had left my old identity behind. I was now fuilly Aerie in 1 month
    <h3>April</h3>
    April is the month i started keepinmg notes, not very well and many aren't about the self. <br>
    At this time i was struggling with my sexuality, I considered myself asexual at this point and was struggling with the romantic aspect of love. I felt aromantic as i had believed i had never felt romantic attraction toward anyone before and that left me sort of broken, helpless feeling that one thing that seemed to bring so many others joy i was simply incapable of.
    <br>I was also hurting because of misgenders, I started writing down any time it happened and assignedf myself alot of self blame for not being "feminine enough"
    <br>at this point i started trying to seperate myself from [Deadname]. I don't remember the context but an exerbt i wrote down was 
    <div class="quote-box">
        <p class="quote-text">
            I am a whole other person from  they are dead and i killed them. none of their bagage effects me.<br>
            We are sperate beings with sperate interests and needs, we want different things and we are only related through continuity.
            <br><b>late April 2023</b>
        </p>
    </div>
    At the end of April i was wearing makeup daily and had a style down. At this point my style was labeled "grandmacore" by my peers, a label i would play into 
    <h3>May</h3>
    In may i had finals, it went smoothly and I got a job at Target in Midtown Atlanta in fullfilment, this gave me alot of time alone with just me and my thoughts. This turned out to be really bad for me later on.
    <br>After the semester ended my name change form went through and i got my first ID with my name on it.
    <br>
    At this point i was still really beat up about being unlovable, it seemed pointless to me now, how would i find someone when i was at school when school was out. my hatred of computers took me off of dating apps but i started to have some slight suicidal (2) nights because of this. 
    I wrote in my notebook reasons i felt that i didn't have a partner as <i>"Asexual, Sad alot, Not fun to do things with, No dating experience, Unrelatable"</i> I also wasn't really trying at the time, but i was under the assumption it wasn't worth it because i was unworthy of love.
    <br>
    <br>It was toward the end of this month that a friend of mine noticed i had dissociated at one point and told me to get it checked out my a mental health professional
    <br>At the end of this month i felt i was passing 70/30, id pass too 70% of strangers i talked too. 
    <h4>27</h4>
    I went to Momocon with a friend, this was the first time i wore a skirt in public and i wore cat ears, a tail and collar, at this point i had almost given up on societal expectations of masculine clothing.
    <h3>June</h3>
    <h4>3</h4>
    I attended Athens pride with some friends from back in my childhood town. we had a great time and i presented extremely femineinely, it was my first time going to a pride event since i started transitioning.
    i decided to go with the label "recipromantic" after believing i had feelings only for people that also had feelings for me (1 example i could think of at the time)
    <h4>12</h4>
    Started a new notebook.
    <br>I started to theorize about my dissociative situation. I wrote in my notes on the subject on the 12th:
    <div class="quote-box">
        <li>I feel like a different person than who i was before</li>
        <li>the body belonged to him and i took it over</li>
        <li>I had a girl in my head when i was little</li>
        <ul><li>This is a reference to when i was little and i believed myself to have 2 voices in my head, a male and a female. I don't remember much about it anymore</li></ul>
        <li>I refer to my past self with he/him pronouns while using she/her for myself</li>
        <li>I need reminders that this is the "real world"</li>
    </div>
    At this point i had started visualizing this past self with the face of my past self, specifically me from 2020<br> 
    I wrote another day that i believed myself to have become the person i wished i could have dated. this is a reference to my measure of self worth from my "femboy days" being how likely i would be to date myself<br>
    I began to see a gap between my consciousness and the world. a floating sensation where i would perceive my self as floating a few feet off the ground. I also investigated my memory issue and believed it to be from not being completely conscious of the world around me or whatever it is im trying to store memories of. I can't store good memories of my physical surroundings without being completely conscious of them and i can't be completely conscious of them with background derealism.
    <br>I related my findings to my childhood when people would say i was "in my own world" in a derogatory manner when i wasn't paying attention. wlthough that could have been a manner of things.
    <br>I found that one of the exchange students my family hosted that i was close too was now presenting as nonbinary
    <br>I wrote about my hatred of being called smart as i felt it was an aspect of [Deadname] and as a result i tend to hide my intelect.
    <br>I picked up Shibari as a hobby as i felt like having a hobby that wasn't digital
    <br>I went to my practitioner and requested a therapist and got one through my doctor's office.
    <h4>therapy sessions start</h4>
    I learned some grounding techniques to use at work as i was often dissociating then.
    I was also told to create a crisis plan incase it gets bad, mine included a call to my mom and deep breaths.
    I tried grounding techniques including music, chew toys, and blankets. 
    <h3>July</h3>
    <h4>1</h4>
    I convinced myself that Aerie was the true self and that it was probably societal preassures that created [Deadname]. 
    <br>I started to tell people about my dissociations. My mom said that she thought i just lost my common snese sometimes. This is probably a reference to the autopilot my body seems to function on when i leave it. My Aunt said I would seem distracted. 
    <br>I had dinner with a friend when i remember afterward that i dissociated halfway through a conversation. I forgot why.
    <br> My therapist tries to find reasons for these dissociations. We come up with trans-microagressions triggering regressions led to them. I was also told to as my friend about what i was like when dissociating so we can figure out if someone else was fronting or if i just left. She told me i had just left and it seemed like i was just tired specifically: i was unchanged and didn't respond to some of her comments. 
    <br>I came up with another theory (this happens a few times): My mind couldn't cope with being male so it came up with a way to escape when confronted with the idea.
    <h4>8</h4>I got spooked by my own reflection when i moved too fast and it moved with me. 
    <h4>9</h4>I wrote a small description of what i was seeing when i was really derealized at work one day "my perifreal vission if fuzzy and you con't focus on anything"
    <h4>10</h4>I started crying when told i deserved food. 
    <h4>12</h4>I recorded my fist instance of warped time. I was at work and the entire day went by in what felt like 2 hours. it was a 6 hour shift.
    <h4>14</h4>I started to use petregression as a coping mechanism more than i should, starts the oversleeping
    <h4>17</h4>I dissociated during the entire bagging process of an order, i had to redo it afterward as many things were in the wrong bags. 
    <h4>19</h4>I was told by my therapist i may have ADHD
    <h4>23</h4>I feel like a burden to my friends and family, still feeling like too much of a burden for a partner
    <h4>27</h4>I had a dizzy spell, it lasted over na hour, i was well hydrated and had never had this happen before, i was eating dinner and could not get the spoon to my mouth. I ran into a wall and stubbed my toe. 
    <h4>29</h4>I used the dissociation to get through work. I went into it on purpose and seemed to "time travel" to the end of my shift in 30 minute incriments.
