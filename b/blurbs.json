Last time i watched it, everyone seemed kind of irrational wih everything they did, but now that i have a better grasp on psychology and how trauma effects a person, most of the actions coincided with common irrational behaviors presented by people suffereing with the traumas the people in the show are dealing with. <br> still probably my favorite anime",
