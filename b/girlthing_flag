    <h1>Girlthing</h1>
    <p>I chose girlthing as my gender microlabel a while ago because it fit pretty well. My views on gender align with the Judith Butler quote: "Gender reality is performative which means, quite simply, that it is real only to the extent that it is performed". Gender is not really internal in my findings, but a way to tell society how you want to be treated. I use the female gender broadly because it is easy and is the binary which most strongly aligns with the way i want society to address me. However, my more nuanced feelings about my performance are not that of human. It is not that i want to be treated not as human, but i would like some of the gratuities society extends to non-human things to be extended to me as well. The specifics are hard to pin down, but the care we put into keeping things clean, the unconditional love we show towards our pets, and the lack of pressure on these 'things' to not be anything, but just to be radiates into my societal wants in the form of gender.</p>
    <h1>the flag</h1>
    <p>there's not alot of good information on the girlthing gender and more importantly for me, no good flags. There seems to be 2 'definitions' of the gender floating around and i identify more with the second one. They have different flags though, and it makes it hard to go flag hunting. The differences sum up to: 1. detached sense of femininity 2. combination of girl and thing. The flags for both are kind of bad except for this one i found:</p>

    I wanted to put it here so it isn't completely lost to time, but this site isn't very search engine friendly. I could probably just post it with the caption "Girlthing Flag" on any social media site and it'll be there, but then i'd have to make a X (formerly known as twitter) account or something.</p>
    <p>Since the original post was lost to time and all that remains is the google archive of it. I get to decide what the colors mean >:3. I've got no solid ideas, but the top represents girl because warm colors and the bottom is thing because it's the other side.
