    <h1>The Music Blog</h1>
    <p style="color: black; margin-left:20px;">My old music blog was too much work to upkeep cause i'd have to explore an entire artist before i feel 'worthy' of writing a post about them, and thus i didn't write that many. So i'm just gonna write short descriptions about albums i've been listning to lately since this is how i listen to music. I'll list the genre and a link incase you wanna go check it out. </p>

            <h2>Diary of Dolls and Death</h2>
            <h3>By: Bambi Baker</h3>
            <p><b>Genre: Morute</b></p>
            <p>Description: This album was originally recommended to me by a friend. It has very dark themes of abuse and mental issues. It peaks my interest in psychology i've had to gain since my mental problems became uncovered. The song <i>Derealization</i> is especially prevalent to me because it feels like she writes it out of experience. The music itself is not very intense, it's slow and leans heavily on piano and similar instruments. The lyrics hit like a train though. They aren't hidden behind metaphors or anything like most heavier songs are. It is mostly in simple plain english.</p>
