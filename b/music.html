    <h1>The Music Blog</h1>
    <p style="color: black;">My old music blog was too much work to upkeep cause i'd have to explore an entire artist before i feel 'worthy' of writing a post about them, and thus i didn't write that many. So i'm just gonna write short descriptions about albums i've been listning to lately since this is how i listen to music. I'll list the genre and a link incase you wanna go check it out. </p>

            <h2>WASTEISOLATION (2018)</h2>
            <h3>By: The Paper Melody</h3>
            <p><b>Genre: Industrial/Noise Pop  <br>Length: 42min (13 songs)</b></p>
            <p>This album is pure emotion. Dabbles into the painful side of the trans experience, religion, trauma, abuse and how they all interact. I will admit: i am a fan of music that discusses the darker side of the psyche. Ratability is a factor, but the things that i can't relate too are so beautifully written that i can feel the pain they felt, or atleast the tiny sliver they wrote into words. The music is extremely chaotic and was my introduction into industrial, which has become one of my favorite genres. Overall, 10/10 chaotic transfem music.</p>

            <h2>The Nightmare Academy (2011)</h2>
            <h3>By: The Paper Melody</h3>
            <p><b>Genre: Experimental Rock  <br>Length: 11min (3 songs)</b></p>
            <p>Another Album from my childhood, I went through a rock phase then shifted away from it. I recently came back to alot of the albums i used to listen too with new ears and this one did not disappoint. The band it was from dropped 3 albums, the last 2 being only 3 songs each, but those 3 songs on either album were amazing. This album is very experimental, but they did everything right in my opinion, very cryptic lyrics, duets, use of very interesting instruments in the songs. I'd recommend giving them a listen, it's only 11 minutes long anyway.</p>

            <h2>Diary of Dolls and Death (2022)</h2>
            <h3>By: Bambi Baker</h3>
            <p><b>Genre: Morute <br>Length: 42min (10 songs)</b></p>
            <p>This album was originally recommended to me by a friend. It has very dark themes of abuse and mental issues. It peaks my interest in psychology i've had to gain since my mental problems became uncovered. The song <i>Derealization</i> is especially prevalent to me because it feels like she writes it out of experience. The music itself is not very intense, it's slow and leans heavily on piano and similar instruments. The lyrics hit like a train though. They aren't hidden behind metaphors or anything like most heavier songs are. It is mostly in simple plain english.
            <br>
            The music videos are amazing.</p>
