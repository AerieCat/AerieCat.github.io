        i am a user of She/It<br>
        i am the she, but what is the it? <br>
        i separate myself in two, divorced from the meat i pilot<br>
        i look in the mirror, theres something there.<br>
        i don't even know what it is<br>
        is that me?<br>
        it might not be human<br>
        it doesn't look like what humans look like<br>
        it's strange, distant, <br>
        parts of it are familiar, comforting even,<br>
        yet parts of it make me feel emotions stronger than anything else.<br>
        dread?<br>
        hate?<br>
        sadness?<br>
        i have learned not to trust my eyes<br>
        because all they see is

            &emsp;The concept of body horror has always captivated me, a fascination deeply intertwined with my personal journey. Throughout my life, i've grappled with a 
            discomfort regarding my own body. It's the epitome of body horrorâ€” the changing of one's body into something unrecognizable, grotesque, and scary.
            Puberty serves as a prime example of this for me.
            <br>
            &emsp;My childhood was riddled with an unease about my own appearance. I never could recognize my own face in a reflection. I could never put a name on what it 
            was at the time, but i have vivid memories of being horrified at the
            changes my body went through. My growing discomfort with myself turned into an indifference toward my appearance. My clothing and presentation were aimed at 
            letting me bland it as best as possible. At the age of 16, I was so horrified at my appearance i took drastic measures to change it. I went from Obese to 
            underweight in a bit over 6 months, desperate for a way out of my discontent. However, no matter what i did, the horror of having a body persisted.
            <br>
            &emsp;Two years later i came out to myself as transgender and in another year i came out to the world. I started Hormone Therapy in February of 2023 and began what
            i saw as the alignment of outward appearance with my inner identity. As my appearance and confidence grew, i grew happier and more content with the body i 
            was stuck in. At this point, it seemed like i had fixed it. I had began to change my body into one that i was comfortable with. Despite the many steps i
            have taken, remnants of my male birth and puberty remain. Seeing my body blossom into something i have began to love around these points of mental 
            anguish have lead to my relationship with my body evolving into something distant or detached. 
            <br>
            &emsp;I am very disconnected from it, to the point i don't refer to it as my self but rather a thing i have, on the same level as an object. I treat it like a tool,
            an outward projection of myself i can decorate as i like, but i don't see it as myself. my detachment manifests itself into many struggles, I cut myself 
            shaving almost daily because of my hatred of facial hair. I dissociate often when showering. I have a deep discomfort with my nude form that contributes heavily
            to a complex relationship with asexuality. There is a corelation between how much i identify with my body and my depressive state. 
            <br>
            &emsp;I can't let my body define me. I am not grotesque; i'm not scary. I am not my body.
