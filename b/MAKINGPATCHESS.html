    <h2>I learned how to make patches!!</h2>
    <p>I am in the process of making a battlejacket (Started in November, it's going to be an eternal WIP but i wear it anyway) and i got some patches from local shows i went to, but i wanted some patches from groups that aren't local or even never made any patches themselves. I have a friend who made a few for me and after seeing the quality and loving how they looked, i decided to learn to make my own. <br>
    I start in GIMP where i turn the images from the band into a monovhrome-ish patch layout. I put each part in a seperate layer so i can turn them on and off depending on which i want to trace for the next step. TIP: for the stencils to work, all the black (background color/nopaint) part of each level needs to be one continuous piece 
    </p>

    <p>Next i tape a piece of construction paper, cut in half, to my screen over the GIMP viewport and trace the sections one color at a time, in this one iended up making the lettering seperate from <a href="https://x.com/stomachbook66/status/1724664129288384930">odette</a> so if i want too in the future i can make some that are just the lettering. Then trace it with a fine tip sharpie.<br>
    Next i cover <b>both</b> sides with packing tape and cut the sharpied sections out very carefully.</p>
