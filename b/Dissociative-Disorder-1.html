    <h1>So, i found out i have DID/OSDD1. What does that mean?</h1>
        <p>
            Dissociative Identity Disorder is characterized by your consciousness being split into pieces. Each part or alter can be viewed as a separate entity or a diverging part of one's self and have varying degrees of "separateness". These parts each have their own opinions, feelings, personalities, and identities. They each go by different names and pronouns and have different visions of themselves.<br>
            These alters form in a tree like fashion, each branching off of each other like a family tree. you would have a core identity and branches of alters. when switching between alters, one may not notice or be aware of who is fronting, it's a fluid stream of consciousness that glides between identities. 
        </p>
    <h2>How does it form?</h2>
        <p>
            We are all born disintegrated, or in separate parts that handle the needs of an infant, around the age of 6 to 9, they form into 1 coherent individual according to the <a href="https://did-research.org/origin/structural_dissociation/">Structural Dissociation Theory</a>. Dissociative identity happens when something stops these parts from integrating due to them having separate needs. This could be trauma or interpersonal conflict. <br>
            In my case, the current theory i have come up with with the help of my mental health professionals is that the weight of societal gender roles and my forced conformity caused me to not integrate as i should have.
        </p>
    <h2>DID or OSDD1?</h2>
        <p>
            I use DID on this page to refer to a range of diagnosis from DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder) to OSDD1 (Other Specified Dissociative Disorder type 1) of which there are both an a and b. The reason i do this is because they all refer to the same symptoms, but varying amounts of them. for example OSDD1 has the following description from the DSM5: '<I>Chronic and recurrent syndromes of mixed dissociative symptoms: This category includes identity disturbance associated with less-than-marked discontinuities in sense of self and agency, or alterations of identity or episodes of possession in an individual who reports no dissociative amnesia.</I>' OSDD1 has 2 subcategories, OSDD1a and OSDD1b with a being for those who's parts are not fully discernable as Alters and b being those who don't experience amnesia between alters. The difference between DID and OSDD1 is mostly up to the psychologist and doesn't have a clear definition for what constitutes "discontinuities in sense of self and agency". My personal experiences are very distinct, my alters have separate names and personalities, but I don't have full amnesia, i will still retain some sort of memory between switches. It will have holes in it, and it will be void of emotions, but the story is mostly continuous. 
        </p>
    <h2>Current Theory</h2>    
        <p>
            The weight of societal gender roles and my forced conformity. especially in a small town environment, caused me to not integrate as i should have since part of me didn't want to conform and part of me had too. This led to me develping a male alter to front while i couldn't be myself. Come Febuary 2023 and i started HRT, and no longer needed that male alter, i switched back to my core (aerie) and the other one became shattered into parts. (Chamomile and Unnamed)

        <p>
            We are discovering more all the time, this is most likely not a complete list. usually, i'll get a huge memory dump and them a new one will front for the first time. the memories between them all are spotty, i (aerie) can remember alot of things about my childhood (i wasn't fronting) but i don't remember any emotions about it and the parts i can remember are outnumbered by the parts i can't. they don't feel like my memories, they were implanted into my memory. they take a lot more effort to recover than my more recent memories that i made while fronting.
