            Getting Gender Affirming Care in the state of Georgia is a lot easier than you'd think if you have health insurance. The cost is as much as seeing a regular doctor plus blood work, and the medication comes out to an average of $25/month for most people. Assuming this path works for you, there are a variety of sources in the Metropolitan Atlanta area for you to choose from.<br>
            What you are looking for is called <b>Informed consent gender affirming care</b>. Informed consent means you don't need a psychiatric evaluation first, you just need to understand the risks involved. This is paperwork your doctor will give you that will list the 'side effects' of the medication. many offices around Atlanta follow this procedure at the time of writing (Nov '24)
