            <h2>What you can do</h2>
            <p>
                In this day and age, visibility is important. Be visibly you (within reasonable safety). Read up on the gay liberation movements of the past and get inspired by the stories. Don't take the cisgender heterosexual world we live in to be the be all end all, if theres something about it you don't like, carve an avenue for yourself and others to not have to deal with it. Liberation is about freeing ourselves from the expectations set upon us by society.
