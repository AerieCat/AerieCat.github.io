        <h3>Comparing 2 anti-trans bills</h3>
        <h4>introduction</h4>
        <p>
        In the past few weeks, numerous anti-trans laws have poassed in the southern states. In tennesee, <a href="https://wapp.capitol.tn.gov/apps/Billinfo/default.aspx?BillNumber=HB0001&ga=113">HB0001</a>, the first bill of the 2023 session, was a bill passed to strip the rights of minors to gender affirming care. This bill was filed for introduction November 9th, 2022 and signed by the govenor March 2nd, 2023 to become law March 22nd, 2023. In Georgia, <a href="https://www.legis.ga.gov/legislation/64231">GA SB140</a> was passed doing the exact same thing. The Georgia website doesn't give a date for filed for introduction, but it does say it was read to the senate Febuary 13th, 2023 and signed by the govenor on March 23rd, 2023 to become law imediately, only 1 day after the Tennesee one became law. The Georgia bill only took 38 days from firstread to inshrined as law.

            <h4>supposed "findings"</h4>
            <p>
                most of these are either false, or missinformed. Tennesee's bill has alot more text to it but besides 'citing' other countries and throwing insom names, they are very similar. 
                
                <br><br>Georgia ites a rise in diagnoses of gender affirming care. Tennesee also cites this in point (g). This is because of societal change. In 1990, the number of gender affirming care patients was not low because people weren't trans, they were lo because it wasn't as safe. and people were uninformed. I only learned what a trans person was in 2020, my school didn't teach me, i wasn't exposed to any trans people. The only reason I knew that being trans was an aoption was because i happened to stumble upon an article about the topic. Now imagine 30 years earlier, much less trans people to learn about, much less safe to be trans in public. The real reason for the explosion in trans people is that it is becoming an actual option for them. Once every trans person gets aquainted with the topic the number will round off. We are in a time of discovery. <br> <br>
                Tennesee cites all of Georgia's points along with some more wild ones.<br><br>
            </p>
            <h4>restrictions</h4>
            Georgia's bill restricts:<br>"(1) Sex reassignment surgeries, or any other surgical procedures, that are performed for
            the purpose of altering primary or secondary sexual characteristics" and
            <br>"(2) Hormone replacement therapies."<br>
            Notice the order. The Georgia bill lists surgery first. I could not find any statistics on how many children in these states were given Gender affirming Surgery, but most Hospitals require you to be 1 year on HRT before you can get on the waiting list for the surgery. You could imagine that not many children have been treated. <br>
            The Tennesee bill prohibits medical procedures that affirm a minor's gender that does not coinside with their sex as defined as "characteristics of the reproductive system"which then if you look back into the definitions, medical procedure is defined as "<i>(A) Surgically removing, modifying, altering, or entering into tissues, cavities, or organs of a human being; or (B) Prescribing, administering, or dispensing any puberty blocker or hormone to a human being;"</i> The tennesee bill does it too, defining surgery before HRT. (and is painful to read)<br><br>
            Why do they define surgery before HRT when HRT is much more prevelant? It's like the goal is to ban the surgery and they took out HRT with it. leading to many more deaths and unhappiness. I will leave off with a quote a freind told me. It isn't inspirational or anything. It just made me realize how bad my mental state was before HRT.
            <h5>You haven't made any suicide jokes since you started HRT</h5>
            I didn't even realize it at the time, but when i started HRT, my mental state improved alot and the jokes i made, might not have been jokes, and i worry that it is worse for many others.
