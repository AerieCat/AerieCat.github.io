    <h3>August 22: added the thought bar</h3>
    I wanted like a way to store my thoughts and get them out like a twitter thread or something, but without twitter or any opther social media. So, i made a little thought bar that loads them in from a JSON.

    moved the navigation keys to the sidebar and added <i>animations</i>
    <h3>August 8: added side bars</h3>
    added some "wings" for the webpage, one displays items from the rss feed and the other one is currently blank.

    <h2>Before August</h2>
    The website had a stacked feel with the navigation buttons on the bottom that would change the central iframe to whatever content was being viewed

    <h3>url structure</h3>
    The website has some code that takes the url and interprets the content in the middle frame from it. All of the content on the webpage is on the same page, it just fills in the center depending on what the url says.
    <br>Example: <h4>Aeriecat.space/#p/weblog</h4>it puts everything after the # in the iframe. (in this case, the file p/weblog) if no file extention is given, it assumes .html
    <h3>lightmode</h3> 
    <img src="weblog-pics/Screenshot from 2023-08-09 02-07-19.png" width="760px" style="border: 1px solid black;">
    the little moon in the corner turns on light mode, this is done using HTML variables. The central iframe does not change
    <h2>old website (April)</h2>
