    <h1>Using DRN to automate my life</h1>
    <p>
        I tend to have some robot girl adjacencies in me and was recently made aware of DRN (Drone Restraint Notation). It's a "programming language" made for drones to use for kink purposes. When i saw it, however, all i could think about was writing little scripts for things i never want to do but should, so the first one i wrote was a getting ready script. I 'ran' it and my usual get ready time of an hour was cut in half to 35 minutes! After this revelation i decided to take it a little more seriously and am writing scripts for a lot of daily functions.

<h2>Scripts</h2>

    <p>script to clean the surfaces in my room as well as do laundry and trash, starts in my bedroom</p> <br>
