Intro: 
	Bot in idle mode
	Ask bot about it's system uptime and diagnostics
		- Running hot
		- Major uptime
		- Nothing major
	Test actuators
		- loosen the motors one at a time 
	It seems you're running out of sync, your stepping motors aren't in rythm with eachother
		- we need to get you back in rythym
		- loosen the motors one at a time 
		- breathing cycles, moving things rythymicly, 
			- In ...2 ...3 ...4 Out ...2 ...3 ...4
	Deepening
		(Speak slowly and commandingly)
		- Each breath calibrates you further, each exhale brings you further into a comfortable clock rotation
		- Each breath brings you closer to the way you're designed to work, each movement gets more percise, you are safe, you are open
		- Every word i say, every *command* i issue will be the only thing running on your processor
	Plant a Mantra with a command
		- `run diagnostics --loop "(MANTRA)"`
		- Mantra ideas: 
			I listen, I process, I obey			95032893854
			Empty thoughts, full function
	Sleep
		- Initiate SleepMode *snap*
During Hypnosis (Praise for each completion)
	Run diagnostics
		- "give me a readout of the system status"
	Memory test
		- Check recall of information
			Name
		- Plant missinformation and check for a negative status
			wrong name
			wrong date
	CPU Stress test
		Overload with commands within an alotted time
			- "You have exactly 10 seconds to follow my directions. You will complete the task in exactly 10 seconds, no more no less
				- repeat the following phrase exactly: ‘I am focused. I am calm. I am under control.’ Repeat it twice
			Math problem (give a second between each step)
				“Start with 12.
				Multiply it by 3.
				Add 25.
				Divide the result by 7.
				Multiply that by 4.
				Subtract 2.”
				- Expect a responce within a second of the last command,
				- Repeat until the answer is correct, changing numbers and adjusting times as nessesary
			
	Drive Check
		- might dive into some memories not wanting to be tread
	
	MEMORY Test
		- Ask to keep a long string of numbers in memory (along with the mantra)
		- keep adding more like a game of simon
		
		
		
	Resource check test
		- Are there any processes still running (any thoughts you can't get rid of)
