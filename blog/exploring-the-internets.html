    <h3>exploring the internets</h3>
    A hobby of mine that i recently picked up is exploring the internet. Not from a search engine, but simply clicking through links on sites and seeing where they go. I realize this isn't really a new thing, or something unique to me and that this was how the internet was used in the begining. However, it does envopke a happy feeling to see sites that don't look corprate or extremely flashy, to see something that was hand made, typed without a guide, and probably really messy on the backend. 
    <br> <br>
    doing this you find sites that are regularly updated, sites that haven't been updated since the late 90s, archives of things you didn't know existed, and personal projects that people poured their heart and soul into that haven't had more than a few hundred visiters. You're exposed to ramblings of people who are probably insane and new ideas that you'd never heard of.

    My explorations were what inspired me to work on this site, and in doing so made me alot more aware of how the internet works
    <h3>how to explore</h3>
    exploration is easy, you find a link, go there, and look for more!
    some things to look out for are buttons and banners.
    Buttons are usually around 88x31 pixels and are made to show allegances and connect other sites together. They can also be used to show things about the website or the site developer. Here's one for example:
    <p><img src="../88x31/aeriecat.space.png"></p>
    Banners are usually 240x60 and are used more as an advertisement. example:
    <p><img src="../banners/Aeriessite.png"></p>
    another thing to look for is a webring, these are sites that all link eachother together. these can make it easier to find new sites as they will usually have a list of sites or easy links to get between them all.
    <h3>where to start</h3>
    if i find a site i find interesting or one that has easy code to put a button on my page I'll put it in my <a href="../index.html#ExternalLinks.html" target="_parent">link list</a> page under 'cool sites i stumble upon'. There's also some helpfull lists on sizeof.cat at <a href="https://sizeof.cat/post/website-discovery/" target="_blank">this post</a>.
