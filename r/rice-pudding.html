    <h2>Rice Pudding</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        1 cup long-grain white rice
        4 cups whole milk
        1/2 cup sugar
        1 teaspoon vanilla extract
        1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

        <h3>Instructions</h3>

        Rinse the rice under cold water then pour the rice and milk into a saucepan, bring it to a simmer on medium heat then lower it back down to low heat until the rice is cooked. 
        now add the sugar, vanilla, and cinamon and stir it, cook it a bit longer until it's at the thickness you want.

        <h3>notes</h3>
        <li>Keep stiring atleast once every 2 minutes</li>
        <li>you might want to add more milk if you want a thin pudding, the 4 cups was really thick and it was more like sticky rice</li>
