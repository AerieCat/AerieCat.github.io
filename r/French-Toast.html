    <h2>French Toast</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        8 inches of french bread (sliced into eight, one inch slices)
        4 eggs
        1 cup of milk
        1 Tbsp sugar
        2 Tbsp Butter

    <h3>Directions</h3>

        Mix the egg, sugar and milk in a large shallow bowl. beat with a fork until theres no more visual egg chunks. butter a frying pan on medium high heat. put a slice of french bread in the egg milk for a minute on both sides then into the pan for 3 minutes on each side, do this for each piece. serve with syrup and powdered sugar

    <h3>notes</h3>
        try to time the bread soaking with the pan flipping like 
        <li>bread into the mix</li>
        <li>flip bread in mix</li>
        <li>bread into the pan</li>
        <li>flip the bread already in the pan</li>
        you can usually fit a few breads in the egg container and on the pan, fit as much as possible.
