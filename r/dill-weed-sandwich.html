    <h2>dillweed sandwich</h2>
        I saw some canned chicken in my pantry and decided to make some chicken salad, but when i was thinking of things to put in it, my mind wandered to a $7 sandwich i had at Ikea. the <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/stores/restaurant/">Skagen Croissant Sandwich</a>. it was a shrimp salad sandwich with dillweed in it. I decided to try to recreate it with chicken!

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <li>1 can shreaded chicken</li>
        <li>4 Tbsp Mayonaise</li>
        <li>a generous amount of dillweed</li>
    <h3>cooking</h3>
        Mix the chicken and mayonaise together, breaking up the chunks of chicken. Next, add the dillweed to taste, i used about a Tablespoon. In the picture i toasted a hamburger bun and put some kale on it, but a croissant would have been better if i had one.
