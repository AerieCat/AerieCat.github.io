    <h1>my taco recipe (work in progress)</h1>
    been working on this for a while, getting the recipe just right. This is a cheap and delicious meal i make every other night or so.
    <h2>
        Ingredients
    </h2>
    <p>
        <li>1 tube of chorizo (9oz) (i use cacique beef)</li>
        <li>1-3 Jalepenos</li>
        <li>1/4 onion</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 potato (optional)</li>
        <li>3 Tbsp chili oil or other oil</li>
        <li>your choice of tortillas (4-6)</li>
        <li>cilantro to garnish</li>
    </p>
    
    <h2>
        cooking
    </h2>
    <p>
        optional potatoes:<br>
        dice up the potatoe and coat in chili oil and your selection of spices. throw these in the airfrier on 400 for about 20 minutes, make sure to jangle them about halfway through.
        <br><br>
        The meat:
        <br>if you are cooking the potatoes, do that before you start preparing the ingredients for the meat, you want them to be done cooking halfway through the meat cooking process.
        <br>dice up the onion and Jalepenos and throw them in a large frying pan with some chili oil (or vegetable oil with some pepper). next throw the tube of chorizo in the pan,
        when it becomes softer break it up with a spatula and mix it with the vegetables. You can really add anything you want in here, i've tried tomatoes, peppers, salsa, etc. but onions and jalepenos is my go too.
        once the potatoes are done, throw them in, they should be crunchy. you want to keep mixing until the chorizo is a dark brown almost crunchy color then throw in the egg to soak up the oils (optional, if you want the oils left in to fry the tortillas in, do not add the egg)
        <br><br>
        preperation:
        <br>
        add a bit of the mixture to each tortilla. if you have oil left in the pan, you can fry the tortillas in it for a minute on both sides for extra flavor. garnish with cilantro (not optional) and hot sauce. I use cholula and crystal on mine.
