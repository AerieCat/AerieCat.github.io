        i was bored so i decided to make this website as a replacement for social media, 
        i just drop things on here that i feel like should have a home on the web.
        i also just make features because im bored from time to time. 
        i update it semi-frequently and typed all the features by hand. 
        If you want to reuse anything, feel free too.
