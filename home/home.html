        i was bored so i decided to make this website as a replacement for social media, 
        i just drop things on here that i feel like should have a home on the web.
        i also just make features because im bored from time to time. 
        i update it semi-frequently and typed all the features by hand. 
        If you want to reuse anything, feel free too.

            I've made leather working my main hobby lately, mainly because i like making little accessories for my outfits. I've been getting out more, going to raves and goth events. I revived this website after being asked if i have any social media and remembering i do in fact have a place to post >:3. I've been getting alot more into music lately, so imma try to fill out the music blog soon.
